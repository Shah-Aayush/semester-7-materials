Minor Project BTech VII Choice form
Dear Students,

For 7th sem minor project, you are required to provide exactly 25 distinct choices of the project titles from the list of definitions shared by us. Note that it is mandatory for all the students to fill this form on or before 12th July 2022, 1 pm. Even if you want to work on your own definition, it is mandatory to fill up 25 distinct choices along with your definition.

Maximum 2 students are allowed to work in a group. Any one of the student from the group has to fill this form and no duplicate or multiple entries for the group will be allowed, if found so their choice form will not be considered and final allocation of topic and guide will be done by coordinators.  Note that few definitions do not require more than one student so in such cases, the definition will be assigned to only one student.

The allocation of project definitions will be done based on the submitted choices using FCFS (First Come, First Serve) algorithm. If none of the submitted choices are available for allocation OR no choice form is submitted , then the definition will be assigned from the available project titles.
