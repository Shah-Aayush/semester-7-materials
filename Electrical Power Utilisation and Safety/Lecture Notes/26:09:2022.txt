# Regrigeration
	- thermostate setting to be changed in winter
	- avg temp : 40F
	- process of cooling substance
	- Application of refrigeration
		- storage of food beverages, ice creams industries, 
		- post mortem
		- medical
	- refrigerators and heat pumps
		- purpose is heat a medium warmer than the surroundings
	- terminologies of refrigeration
		- capacity of refrigeration unit
			- expressed by their ollign capacity
	- 1 ton = 12000 BTU
	- latent heat of ice = 336 kj/kg
	- one ton of refrigeration = 233.333 kj/min
		> 3.8889 kj/sec
	- coefficient of performance
		- ratio of heat extracted in a given time to the work input.
		- always greater than 1.
		> The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat (which, if 100% efficient, would be a COP of 1), it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required. Most air conditioners have a COP of 2.3 to 3.5.
	- examples of refrigerants
		- air
		- ammonia
		- co2
		- so2
		- freon
		- methyl chloride
		- methylene chloride
	- two types of refrigerants
		- primary
		- secondary
	- refrigeration cyccle and its components
