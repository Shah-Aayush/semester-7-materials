## Modes of transfer of heat
1. Conduction
	- **molecule** of substance **gets heated** and transfers the heat to adjacent molecule
	- heat transfer without the movement of actual molecules
	- rate of conduction of heat along the substance depends upon the temperature gradient
	- ex.: Refractory heating, heating of insulating materials etc.
2. Convection
	- heat transfer from one part to another part or fluid due to **actual motion of the molecules**
	- rate of heat depends on difference in fluid density at different temperaures
	- quantity of heat depends on temperature of heating element, size of surface of heater, position of heater
	- ex.: immersion water heater
3. Radiation 
	- heat transfers from source to the substance to be heated without heating the medium in between
	- dependent on surface
	- rate of heat radiation is given by stefan's law
	- ex.: Solar heater

## Heating element materials
- high specific resistance 
- high melting temperature
- low temperature coefficient of resistance
- high oxidising temperature
- positive temperature coefficient of resistance
- ductile
- mechanical strength

## Design of heating element
- 20-30 different factors engineerings have to consider in desinging them
	- voltage and current
	- length and diameter of the element
	- type of material
	- opearing temperature
- heating elements used : 
	- wires of circular cross section
	- rectangular conductying ribbons
- steady state condition : `P=H`
	- P : power input
	- H : heat dissipated
	> heating element is switched on, temperature goes on increasing and finally a high steady state temperature is reached. all heat then being transferred through radiations
- As per **stefan's law of radiation**, heat radiated by a hot body is given by 
	- H = 5.72eK[ (T1/100)^4 - (T2/100)^4] W/m^2
	- T1 : temp of hot body
	- T2 : temp of cold body 
	> both in K
	
- K : radiant efficiency 
	- single element : 1
	- more then one element : 0.5 to 0.8
- e : emissivity : 1 for black body
	- 0.9 for resistance heating element

- P = V^2/R W

- P = V^2 pie d^2 / 4 rhaw l

# Resistance heating
- uses heat generated by joule effect in a conductive body
- workpiece/charge to be heated is treated as a resistance and current passes through it.
	- charge in form of powder, small solid pieces or liquid
	- two electrodes are inserted in the charged connected to AC or DC
- two electrodes in case of 2phase, 3 in case of 3phase
- in case of highly conductive metals, highly resistive powder is sprinkled in between the surfaces of pieces to avoid short circuit
- more heat produced at contact surfaces
- used in salt bath furnaces, electrode boiler for heating water
- **Advantages of molten salt bath**
	- operation temperature range : 175 to 1260 C
	- parts do ont scale/deteriorated surfaces as fully protectted while they are in molten bath
	- wide variety of salts are available including salts that change the surface chemistry of the steel
	- gives rapid, uniform heating
- electrode steam boiler
	- electrode boilers
## indirect resistance heating
- current passed through element of high resistance
- current produces `I^2R` loss
- heat passes by radiation and convection
- ex.: room heater, hair drier, soldering iron, flat iron, immersion heater etc.

## difference b/w oven and furnace
|oven|furnace|
|---|---|
|used for warming, drying, tempering| used in industrial settings : to heat treat and process metals and materials |
|max operating temp:about 70C|above 535C|
|-|has insulating and refractory materials|

- High temp insulating lining
	- ensure operator safety
	- reduce amount of heat dissipation
- Refractory lining
	- withstand very high temp.
	- prevent corrosion to liquid metal 
	- resistant to hot abrasion and erosion

- hearth plate : to support a body of conductive material
	> means for passing through said body an electric current

## Induction heating/ non contact heating
- developed using electromagnetic induction
- **electromagnetic induction:** current generated in closed circuit by the fluctuation of current in another circuit placed next to it
- induction heating relies on 2 mechanisms of energy dissipation for the purpose of heating
	- joule heating
	- magnetic hysteresis
- coild surrounding workpiece fed with alternating current and resulting magnetic flux couples with workpiece
- based on *lenz's law*, current is in direction that it attenuates*(reduce the effect)* the field of the coil

- direct induction heating
	- current induced in body to be heated
- indirect induction heating
	- eddy current induced in heating element
	- heat transffered to body by *radiation* and *convection*
- induction furnaces
	- core type [low frequency induction:<1kHz]
		- direct core type
		- vertical core type
		- indirect core type
	- coreless type [high frequency induction:>50kHz]
- induction heating
	- used to heat work direclty
	- induced current flow in the electrically conduction object being heated
## Direct CORE type induction furnace
- **pinch effect** : transformer secondary current density exceeds 500 A/cm^2 then due to interaction of secondary current with teh alternating magnetic field, molten metal is squeezed to the extedn that secondary circuit is interrupted.
- single turn short circuited secondary 
	- magnetically coupled to the primary by iron core
- circular hearth
	- contains the charge to be melted in form of *annular ring*
- no molten metal in ring => secondary becomes open-circuited
	- to start the furnace, molten metal has to be poured in annualr hearth / sufficient molten metal is allowed to remain in crucible 
- since, magnetic coupling b/w primary, secondary is very poor
	- results in high leakage, low power factor
	- difficulty overcome by employing supply frequencies as low as 10 hz.

### Drawbacks of direct core type induction furnace
- has to be run on low-frequency supply
	- which entails extra expenditure on motor-generator set/ frequency convertor
- suffers from pinching effect
- crucible for charge is of odd shape
	- inconvenient for tapping molten charge
- doesn't function if no molten metal in hearth
- not suitable for intermittent serivce

### Advantages
- melting is rapid, clean
- temperature can be controlled easily
- inherent stirring action of the charge by electromagnetic forces ensures greater uniformity of the end product

## Vertical core type induction furnace / AJAX WYATT furnace
- v shaped channel in vertical plane below the hearth
- magnetic coupling better than direct core induction type furnace
- leakage reactance is comparatively low and power factor is high
- tendency of current to interrupt secondary circuit *(due to pinch effect)* is avoided as weight of charge in the main body of the crucible
- circulation of molten metal is kept up round the vee portion by convection, electromagnetic forces
- chances of discontinuity of circuit are less
	- useful for continous operation
- powerfactor : 0.8 to 0.83
	- can be operated at power frequency
- used for melting non ferrous metals such as brass, zinc and tin

### Merits of AJAX-WYATT furnace
- accurate control of temperature
- uniform castings
- absence of crucibles
- consisten performance and simple control
- no combusion gases, 
	- elimating most common source of metal contamination
- highly efficient heat.
	- low running cost, improved performance
- high power factor
