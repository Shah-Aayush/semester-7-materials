## Electrical safety, earthing and devices

- Electrical earthing
> Earthing is defined as “the process in which the instantaneous discharge of the electrical energy takes place by transferring charges directly to the earth through low resistance wire.” Low resistance earthing wire is chosen to provide the least resistance path for leakage of fault current.

- Necessity of electrical earthing
> Ensures the safety of electrical appliances and devices from the excessive amount of electric current. Helps in the flow of electric current directly inside the ground. Keeps the electric appliance safe from the damage. It protects building breakdown from the lightning.

- Protection against Electric Shock
	- Dos and don'ts to avoid electric shocks at home
		- Image result for Protection against Electric Shock
		- Dos and don'ts to avoid electric shocks at home
		- Never use a damaged extension cord.
		- Never use a defective electrical device.
		- Pull on the plug and not on the cable to unplug an electrical device.
		- Unplug the toaster before trying to dislodge stuck toast.
		- Before changing a lightbulb, switch the light off or unplug the lamp.
	> Two levels of protective measures exist: The earthing of all exposed-conductive-parts of electrical equipment in the installation and the constitution of an equipotential bonding network

- Components of Electrical Earthing
	- Earth wells and accessories,
	- Earthing grid conductors,
	- Marshalling earth buses (earthing distribution buses),
	- Earthing wires and cables.

- Touch and Step Potential
> Step potential is the voltage between the feet i.e. one step of a person standing near an energized grounded object. Touch potential is the touch voltage between the energized object and the feet of a person in contact with the object.

> a step potential as it can cause voltage difference between a person's feet. Touch potential is the voltage between any two points on a person's body – hand to hand, shoulder to back, elbow to hip, hand to foot and so on.

- Factors Affecting Resistence of Earthing Electrodes

## Electrical Safety

- Electrical Injuries
> Electric current can cause injury in four ways: Cardiac arrest due to the electrical effect *(SHOCK)* on the heart. *(MUSCLE)*, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body. *(THERMAL BURN)* from contact with the electrical source. Falling *(LOSS OF MUSCLE CONTROL)* or injury after contact with electricity.
	- Electric shock.
	- Electrical burns.
	- Loss of muscle control.
	- Thermal burns.

- How to reduce electrical injuries
	- Never use a damaged extension cord.
	- Never use a defective electrical device.
	- Pull on the plug and not on the cable to unplug an electrical device.
	- Unplug the toaster before trying to dislodge stuck toast.
	- Before changing a lightbulb, switch the light off or unplug the lamp.

- Usage of electrical Protective Devices
> Electrical protection devices are applied to existing electrical equipment to prevent any mishaps or abnormal functioning. These devices can identify and address unacceptable problems and take necessary corrective action.

- Various unsafe practices regarding Electrical Safety
> There should not be any loose wires as well. Also ensure that no electrical cables run through high-traffic areas, under carpets or across doorways. Plug for all electrical equipment's should be firmly fitted in its socket. Be aware that loose-fitting plugs can potentially cause equipment to overheat and catch fire.

- Indian Standards for Electrical Safety
> The IS − 732 (1989) standard pertains to electrical installation. It regulates the design of installation, selection and erection of equipment and inspection and testing of the wiring system.

## Types of Wiring

- Factors Affecting the Selection of Wiring
	1. Durability
	2. Safety
	3. Appearance
	4. Accessibility
	5. Cost
	6. Maintenance Cost

- Types of Internal Wiring
	- Cleat Wiring
	> This type of wiring uses a system of cleats to secure insulated wires in place and lay them out in the electrical grid. The cleats are usually made from wood or porcelain and in two parts that you screw into place. The bottom cleat (the one facing the wall) is grooved to allow space for wiring.
	- Casing and capping wiring
		- a) CTS or TRS or PVC sheath wiring
		- b) Lead sheathed or metal sheathed wiring
	> It's an electrical wiring method where PVC insulated wires are placed in plastic casings and covered with a cap. The casing and capping system is often used for household wiring, wire distribution, protection to other wiring systems, offices, and devices with low voltage use.
	- Batten wiring:
		- a) Surface or open Conduit type
		- b) Concealed or underground type Conduit
	> In this, insulated wires are run through the straight teak wooden battens. The wooden battens are fixed on the ceilings or walls by plugs and screws. The cables are fitted onto the battens by using tinned brass link clips. These clips are fixed to the battens with rust-resistant nails.
